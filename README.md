# wireframes

Some basic wireframes I made for practice

Things to note:
- Yellow sticky notes are for red-belt-like features
- Purple Sticky notes are for black-belt-like features

Most of these are harder than the actual exams and you should not attempt unless you have finished everything else!
Keep in mind, these are overall harder than an actual exam, and are intended to push the limits of what you can do.
Wireframes in order from easiest to hardest:
- Tasks (red features only)
- Questions
- Inbox
- Dating
